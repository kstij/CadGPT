This project converts text prompts into 3D models using AI/ML techniques. It provides a web interface where users can input text descriptions and receive corresponding 3D models.

## Features
- Text-to-3D model conversion
- Web interface for easy interaction
- Support for various 3D model formats
- Real-time preview

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage
1. Enter your text prompt describing the 3D model you want to generate
2. Click "Generate" and wait for the model to be created
3. Download the generated 3D model in your preferred format
